# APOD
APOD is a Progressive Web Application.

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration or better known as NASA, is responsible for an amazing project known as - 'Astronomy Picture of The Day'. They release an awesome image everyday.

They also have an API that lets us application developers use these images. And this is exactly what I have done. This application displays the APOD's in a beautiful way. Also as an added perk, if an image of the day catches your eye, you can save it and view it at any time of your choice, even if you don't have an internet connection.

Features Include: 

1) Save POD's for offline access

    Save any POD for offline access and view it whenever you like.


2) View Random APOD

    Clicking on the little floating button on the bottom right corner displays a random Picture of the day from 1995 to the present day.


3) View Specific POD

    You can also view the picture of the day from a specific date.


Also, if you are using this on a mobile device, you will get the option to add the app to your homescreen. Should you choose to do so, this application will be installed on your device and you will get a complete native application experience.
